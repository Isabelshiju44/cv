      I am an indian student studying in NPS indiranagar, Bangalore. Born at Manipal Hospital, to <em>Nimble Shiju</em> and <em>Shiju Joseph</em>, I live with my family. I love chocolate and Pasta. My birthday is on 11 February 2009 and i am 12. I love doing some craft and i have a lot of friends. I love marvel movies, and my favourite chracter is iron man. I also love Harry Potter books, especially Hermoine Granger. I haven't exactly decided what i want to be in the future, but so far i want to be a web developer. I love writing articles and i blog on <a href="https://medium.com/@isabelshiju">my Medium profile</a>. I also love painting, acting and swimming. I have made many paintings and enjoy getting messy in my work. I also enjoy baking with my mother. I love debating and am an interested munner in the Bangalore circuit.
